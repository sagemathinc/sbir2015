# Overview, Key Words, and Subtopic Name
This project will create an
interactive online homework system called
``SageCloud Interactive Problems'' (SCIP) that
will initially target students taking courses
in advanced computational mathematics.
SCIP will provide realtime feedback, analytics, deeper
computational problems than are offered by existing systems, and
improved interaction between students and instructors.

# Intellectual Merit

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
create a completely new homework system that uniquely addresses needs in
advanced mathematics, including abstract algebra,
number theory, algebraic geometry, combinatorics
and differential equations.  The main technical hurdles that the
team faces are to
implement an easy-to-use interface and language for creating
problems, a way to automatically test problems, a workflow for
peer review of problems, and a marketplace where problems may
be shared, purchased, and assembled into homework assignments.
Additional hurdles involve dealing effectively with large amounts
of user data and detecting cheating.   To achieve these
goals the team will build on their experiences developing
Sage and SageMathCloud to implement minimal usable first versions,
then get community feedback from  a large community of users that
the team has cultivated over many years, and use feedback to
iterate on the initial product.

# Broader/Commercial Impact

The proposed interactive homework system would increase the value
of SageMathCloud, so there will be more paying customers.  The resulting
revenue could then provide a sustainable source of support for open source
mathematical software development, which would make it possible
to address quality issues
in many open source math projects that are otherwise
difficult to address.
With open source software,
moving beyond a small user base of highly technical users involves addressing
a huge number of difficult issues that have
little to do with research mathematics.

Our proposed homework system would fill a gaping need in
math-related education, especially at the advanced level,
which will raise technological capabilities of the workforce.
The free version will also be accessible online to people worldwide
who are unable to afford advanced mathematical software.
